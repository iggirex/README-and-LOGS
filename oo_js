SCOPE

GLOBAL SCOPE -- Every scope is within global scope. If there are no other scopes, then this is the only scope.

LEXICAL SCOPE -- happens everytime a function is made. spans from "f" to closing curly bracket. 
                 variables declared in a lexical scope cannot be accessed from out of the scope, will throw error.
                 Other code blocks made by curly braces (loops, conditionals) do not create scopes.
                 
EXECUTION CONTEXT -- (or In-Memory Scopes) differ from Lexical Scopes. They are built as the code is run (not written out) 
                  -- this rules what variables are available to what scopes at run time
                  -- for each Lexical Scope, there might be many In-Memory Scopes depending on how many times function is run
                  -- Stores key value pairs and their contexts (scopes)
                  
THIS -- keyword which gets a value bound to it, like a variable except it gets bound to the correct object according to binding rules.
     -- "this" is bound at call time to the object that calls "this"'s function. So "this" must be part of an object's method.
     -- Example obj.fn(3, 4)
     -- "this" keyword is always bound to the object LEFT OF THE DOT at call time. so "obj" is bound to "this".
     
PROTOTYPE CHAIN -- Mechanism of creating objects that resemble other objects.
                -- Can free up memory space, avoid code duplication
                -- Makes an object behave as if it had all the properties of another object
                -- Does this by delegating all failed lookups to the other object.
        ---> EX
        var myArr = []
        myArr.push("hey");

        // myArr never had a "push" method added to it, so it looks up the prototype chain to Array.prototype.push
        // so the failed "push" method was passed up its prototype chain and found the method in this other object.
        
THE OBJECT PROTOTYPE -- The uppermost object to which all javascript objects end up pointing to
                     -- All failed lookups for javascript objects will eventually delegate up to the object prototype
                     -- Where all basic methods are provided to all objects
                     -- "this" keyword will point to the left of the dot, to the object that called it(even if the delegation went up the chain)
                     -- this allows these objects to share the method and have "this" work correctly
    --->EX
    var obj = {}
    obj.toString();
    
    // toString() will fail lookup in obj because it's empty, so then it gets delegated up from obj to the object prototype

Different ways to create objects in JS
    ---> Extending an object will create multiple objects and their methods,all holding a places in memory.
    ---> Object.create() creates a pointer to one place in memory. So the new object points to the original object.
    ---> Any change to the original object will be an immediate change on the Object.created object.

        var gold = {a: 1};

        var blue = extend({}, gold);
        blue.b = 2

        var rose = Object.create(gold)
        rose.b = 2
        gold.z = 3

        console.log(blue.z) // error, z not defined
        console.log(rose.z) // 3

Object Decorator Pattern
    ---> This is a way to increase code reusability and cut down on duplicate code
    ---> By creating functions that interact with objects that have similar needs, code can get better.
    ---> This example is making different cars for a game:
        
        var amy = {location: 1};
        amy.loc++;
        var ben = {location: 9};
        ben.loc++;
        
        --->Refactored to:
        
            var move = function(car){
                car.loc++;
            }
            var amy = {location: 1};
            move(amy);
            var ben = {location: 9};
            move(ben);
            
        ---> Refactored even more to:
            
            var carlike = function(obj, loc){
                obj.loc = loc;
                return obj;
            }
            var move = function(car){
                car.loc++;
            }
            var amy = carlike({}, 1);
            move(amy);
            var ben = carlike({}, 9);
            move(ben);
                
            //NOTE: (it's common to use ADJECTIVES for object decorator functions, hence 'carlike')
            
        ---> Refactored to include the "move" function as an obj property:
        
             var carlike = function(obj, loc){
                obj.loc = loc;
                obj.move = move;
                return obj;
            }
            var move = function(){
                this.loc++;
            }
            // "this" will refer to the obj to the left of the dot when move is called, so in ben.move(), 'this' is ben

            var amy = carlike({}, 1);
            amy.move();
            var ben = carlike({}, 9);
            ben.move();
