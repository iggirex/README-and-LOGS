        -Single --> single image
        -Multiple --> sprite sheet
        --Polygon --> not square shaped image

    Texture Type
        -Sprite(2D and UI) --> Preserved black space, access to Sprite Editor
        Pivot --> What is the center of the sprite, point where image will rotate
        Generate Mip Map --> Smaller images appear as sprite if it is to appear further away (uses persepective camera)
        Filter Mode --> Determines how image will look closer or further away (persepective camera)
                    --> Billinear & Trilinear: closer & further will blurr
                    --> Point: will get blocky

Layers
---------------------------------

Easiest way to deal with layers is changing the Z transfrom THIS IS BAD!!!
---> If you want sprites to collide with each other (which you do in 2D game) they will never collide if
     they are not on same Z coordinate.

GOOD WAY:
---> Change SORTING layer --> click "layers", select "sorting layer" and add layers

---> Lower layer is on list, closer it will appear

--> to apply sorting layer to sprite, select sprite, and then "sorting layer" and select appropriate layer.

--> Things on same layer: change order in "Order in Layer"

---> Sorting layer OVERRIDES Z AXIS ---> In 3d space a sprite could be behind another, but in orthographic
    view, it can appear on top of the other if sorting layer states so

Good layers for starting out = 3 sorting layers
1) background
2) foreground
3) middleground
