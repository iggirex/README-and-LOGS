Sprites Import Settings
---------------------------------

    Sprite Mode
        -Single --> single image
        -Multiple --> sprite sheet
        --Polygon --> not square shaped image

    Texture Type
        -Sprite(2D and UI) --> Preserved black space, access to Sprite Editor
        Pivot --> What is the center of the sprite, point where image will rotate
        Generate Mip Map --> Smaller images appear as sprite if it is to appear further away 
                            (uses persepective camera)
        Filter Mode --> Determines how image will look closer or further away (persepective camera)
                    --> Billinear & Trilinear: closer & further will blurr
                    --> Point: will get blocky
        -Packing Tag --> Unity puts all sprites into one 
        ->Default Size and Compression Settings

Layers
---------------------------------

Easiest way to deal with layers is changing the Z transfrom THIS IS BAD!!!
---> If you want sprites to collide with each other (which you do in 2D game) they will never collide if
     they are not on same Z coordinate.

GOOD WAY:
---> Change SORTING layer --> click "layers", select "sorting layer" and add layers

---> Lower layer is on list, closer it will appear

--> to apply sorting layer to sprite, select sprite, and then "sorting layer" and select appropriate layer.

--> Things on same layer: change order in "Order in Layer"

---> Sorting layer OVERRIDES Z AXIS ---> In 3d space a sprite could be behind another, but in orthographic
    view, it can appear on top of the other if sorting layer states so

Basic layers for starting out = 3 sorting layers
1) background
2) foreground
3) middleground

Other setup:

1) Ground, dirt
2) Above ground (building floors)
3) Obstacles (walls, furniture)
4) Interactables (pickups, weapons)
5) Characters

CANVASES AND UIs
---------------------------------

UI Canvas --> Game Object that holds all of the UI elements
                When created will be bigger than camera, will have to zoom out to see it fully. can double click

        ---> Must exist to add UI elements

        ---> RENDER MODE: dictates where in the scene UI elements will display
            SCREEN SPACE - OVERLAY (most common) -- Will make all UI elements render in front of everything
                            This canvas will resize based on size of screen, not of camera

            SCREEN SPACE - CAMERA - Like screen overlay, except things are rendered as if they were a specific
                                    distance from the camera
                                  - For 2D games, use this for background images (that should scale with camera)


            WORLD SPACE - UI elements render in world space coordinates, doesnt use camera

    UI ELEMENTS:
        PANEL: usefule for laying out UI, and want things to scale with screen size change




Disable Anti Aliasing in Edit/Quality --> its for 3D games
