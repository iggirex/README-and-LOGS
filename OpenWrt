Easy OpenWrt Setup with Docker

https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/docker_openwrt_image

docker import http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/x86/generic/openwrt-x86-generic-rootfs.tar.gz openwrt-x86-generic-rootfs

check to see if it worked:
docker run -i openwrt-x86-generic-rootfs cat /etc/banner

open shell:
docker run -i -t openwrt-x86-generic-rootfs /bin/ash

OpenWrt Setup with VirtualBox
----------------------------

Get OpenWrt running in VirtualBox:
https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox#setting_up_networking


To get SSH to work: (https://hoverbear.org/2014/11/23/openwrt-in-virtualbox/)
    Now in /etc/config/firewall we can add a rule to fix this:

    # ... Other Rules ...

    # Allow SSH on wan
    config rule
            option src              wan
            option proto            tcp
            option dest_port        22
            option target           ACCEPT

Changing UCI
(https://www.gilesorr.com/blog/virtualbox-openwrt.html)
The first problem you're likely to notice after booting is that you don't have a network. OpenWRT assumes it's 192.168.1.1/24, which is rarely true with VirtualBox. I've solved the problem in two ways:

Method 1:

# uci show network # doesn't change anything
# uci set network.lan.ipaddr=10.0.2.15
# uci set network.lan.netmask=255.255.255.0
# uci commit # this updates file /etc/config/network
# ifdown lan
# ifup lan
