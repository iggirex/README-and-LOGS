OMG ----> @media queries are AWESOME!!

@media all and (min-width: 480px) {
    THIS WILL WORK at 480px width and ABOVE!
}

@media all and (min-width: 300px) {
    THIS WILL WORK FROM 300px width up to 480px, at 480 the above media query will override
}

        meaning of the not, only and and keywords:

        not: The not keyword reverts the meaning of an entire media query.

        only: The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media 
        features from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.

        and: The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features.

        They are all optional. However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a media type.


You can also have different stylesheets for different media, like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)" href="widescreen.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="smallscreen.css">
