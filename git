UNDO THIS THING I JUST DID!

    undo changes before they have been "git add"ed
    $ git checkout -- <file_name>

    stash changes before they have been "git add"ed
    $ git stash

    undo changes after they have been "git add"ed
    $ git reset <file_name> || git reset

    undo changes after git commit


WHERE AM I

    go back and forth in commit history
    $ git checkout <commit_hash>

    what commit am I currently on?
    $ git show


FUN WITH BRANCHES

    delete branch locally and remotely
    $ git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>
    $ git branch -d <branch_name>
